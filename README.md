# Question 1
The datasets are read using read_csv() and Sex and Embark are replaced with numerical values for finding the correlation heatmap shows the correlation and Sex has the highest value of the correlation<br>
We need to keep the "Sex" feature because it has high correlation with survived which is the feature which is to be found<br>
Accuracy_score() is used to find the accuracy 
# Question 2
Train_test_split() is used to split the training and testing data and random state=0 gives the same testing and training split every time<br>
# Question 3
Naive bayes has more accuracy than the support vector machine from the above because the features given are independent and their is no linear seperation boundary
